Q: What are data structures?
A: Data structures are ways to store and organize data so it can be used efficiently in programs.

Flashcard 2

Q: Why are data structures important?
A: They are essential for coding interviews, computer science subjects, and building efficient real-world applications.

Flashcard 3

Q: What is an Array?
A: An array is an ordered collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.

Flashcard 4

Q: What is zero-based indexing?
A: It means the first element of an array is stored at index 0, not 1.

Flashcard 5

Q: What are the advantages of arrays?
A:

Fast access/read time → O(1)

Simple and widely used

Flashcard 6

Q: What are the disadvantages of arrays?
A:

Slow insertion and deletion → O(n)

Requires contiguous memory

Flashcard 7

Q: What happens when you insert an element in the middle of an array?
A: All elements must shift, and sometimes memory must be reallocated.

Flashcard 8

Q: What is a Linked List?
A: A linked list is an ordered collection of elements where each element points to the next one.

Flashcard 9

Q: How is a linked list stored in memory?
A: Elements are stored in non-contiguous memory locations and connected using pointers.

Flashcard 10

Q: Advantage of linked lists over arrays?
A:

Fast insertion and deletion → O(1) (after locating position)

Flashcard 11

Q: Disadvantage of linked lists?
A:

Slow access/search → O(n)

No indexing

Flashcard 12

Q: Key difference between arrays and linked lists?
A:

Arrays: fast access

Linked Lists: fast insert/delete

Flashcard 13

Q: What is a Hash Map?
A: A data structure that stores data in key-value pairs.

Flashcard 14

Q: How is a hash map different from an array?
A:

Uses keys instead of indexes

Unordered

Faster searching

Flashcard 15

Q: Time complexity of hash map operations?
A:

Search: O(1)

Insert: O(1)

Delete: O(1)

Flashcard 16

Q: What are hash maps called in Python?
A: Dictionaries

Flashcard 17

Q: What is a Stack?
A: A data structure that follows LIFO (Last In, First Out).

Flashcard 18

Q: Stack operations?
A:

Push → add element

Pop → remove top element

Peek → view top element

Flashcard 19

Q: Real-life example of a stack?
A: Stack of plates or pancakes

Flashcard 20

Q: What is a Queue?
A: A data structure that follows FIFO (First In, First Out).

Flashcard 21

Q: Queue operations?
A:

Enqueue → add at back

Dequeue → remove from front

Front → view first element

Flashcard 22

Q: Real-life example of a queue?
A: Grocery store line or YouTube playlist

Flashcard 23

Q: What is a Tree?
A: A hierarchical data structure made of nodes connected by edges.

Flashcard 24

Q: What is a root node?
A: The topmost node of a tree.

Flashcard 25

Q: What is a Binary Tree?
A: A tree where each node has at most two children.

Flashcard 26

Q: What is a Binary Search Tree (BST)?
A:

Left child < parent

Right child > parent

Flashcard 27

Q: Time complexity of searching in a BST?
A: O(log n)

Flashcard 28

Q: Why are trees efficient for searching?
A: They eliminate half of the remaining data at each step.

Flashcard 29

Q: What is a Graph?
A: A data structure made of nodes and edges representing connections.

Flashcard 30

Q: How are graphs different from trees?
A:

Can have cycles

Nodes can have multiple connections

Can be directed or undirected

Flashcard 31

Q: What are weighted graphs?
A: Graphs where edges have values like distance or cost.

Flashcard 32

Q: Real-life applications of graphs?
A:

Google Maps / shortest path

Uber ride matching

Social networks

Flashcard 33

Q: Why are graphs considered difficult?
A: They have fewer restrictions and many variations.

Flashcard 34

Q: Order of data structures from easiest to hardest?
A:
Arrays → Linked Lists → Hash Maps → Stacks/Queues → Trees → Graphs
